## How to use it

You need to run `Server.java` first, after that, you can run as many clients as you want.

 ```sh 
 javac Server.java && java Server
 ```

### You only need to run this once or if you modify the file 
  ```sh
  javac Client.java  
  ```
### Run this in a different terminal window for each client you want 
  ```sh
  java Client  
  ```
